# MarkovProcesses

Contains programming exercises for the lecture course "Markov Processes" at Universität Bonn in winter term 2020/2021.  
Sheet 7 contains the implementation of the Euler-Maruyana discretization of a SDE. There are plots of the sample paths of the following processes:
- Two dimensional Brownian motion
- Standard two dimensional OU process
- Randomly perturbed rotaion
- Randomly perturbed rotaion with damping
- Physical Brownian motion
- OL in double-well potential

In addition to the sample paths also the ergodic averages of the components of the processes are computed and plotted.
